<p class="txt">In Blue Lock: Ground Zero, you donâ€™t just play soccerâ€”you build your identity as a future striker god. 
    Set in a brutal training program inspired by the legendary Blue Lock project, players drop into the Ground Zero Facility, 
    a new-generation training camp designed to forge the worldâ€™s deadliest forward.</p>

    <p class="sectxt">But hereâ€™s the twistâ€”your abilities arenâ€™t fixed.</p>

    <p>You roll from a massive Ability Pool, fusing 2â€“3 powers into your custom Playstyle Build. Each combo creates a 
      unique Titleâ€”whether itâ€™s Phantom Winger, Zone Annihilator, or Skybenderâ€”and defines how the world sees you. 
      Want to dominate mid-air duels with teleport jumps and curve flicks? Or become an invisible predator with shadow 
      clones and breakaway bursts? Itâ€™s all on you.</p>

    <p class="komp">ðŸ”¹ Train, Climb, Eliminate.</p>
<p>Start from the bottom with nothing but dreams and sweat. Clear ego trials, outplay real players, and climb through rankings. 
Every round, someoneâ€™s eliminatedâ€”and only the most unhinged, creative, and hungry strikers survive.
</p>

<p class="komp">ðŸ”¹ Ego Defines Your Path.</p>
<p>Your build, your story, your name. Whether you rock an auto-generated legacy title or name your playstyle like a legend, 
your identity becomes part of the lore. Youâ€™re not a numberâ€”youâ€™re a problem.</p>

<p class="komp">ðŸ”¹ PvP, PvE, and Rival Mode.</p>
<p>Fight in real-time 3v3, 5v5, or 1v1 matches. Enter Ego Dungeons to master your abilities solo. Face off in Rival Mode, 
where you challenge elite AI builds and climb the World Ego Ladder.</p>
